# ðŸš€ Mastering JavaScript 
### This is a Javascript studies purpose repository. ðŸ“š

I've been on an Udemy course about modern web development with Javascript and I plan to bring here everything I'll be learning there.

âš  Before I started this repository I had finish a big part of the fundamentals, so this will not be included here. Also, before starting this course I had study Javascript, so I already knew lots of the concepts, but wanted to master it. âš
