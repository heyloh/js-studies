# 🏆 Mastering JavaScript 
### This is a repository for JavaScript study purposes. 📚

I've been on an Udemy course about modern web development with Javascript and I plan to bring here everything I'll be learning there.

⚠ Before I started this repository I had finish a big part of the fundamentals, so this will not be included here. Also, before starting this course I had study Javascript, so I already knew lots of the concepts, but wanted to master it. ⚠

I'm also challenging myself to write everything in english here, sorry if there are grammatical mistakes I'm not the best on it... Yet. 😉
