# ðŸš€ Mastering JavaScript 
### This is a Javascript studies purpose repository. ðŸ“š

I've been on an Udemy course about modern web development with Javascript and I plan to bring here everything I'll be learning there.

âš  Before I started this repository I had finish a big part of the fundamentals, so this will not be included here. Also, before starting this course I had study Javascript, so I already knew lots of the concepts, but wanted to master it. âš 

I'm also challenging myself to write everything in english here, sorry if there are grammatical mistakes I'm not the best on it... Yet. ðŸ˜‰
