# ðŸ¤” Callback Functions

Basically, callback is passing a function to another function and when an event happens the function you first passed is called (back ðŸ˜‰).

## ðŸ‘€ Standard Observer
### The most used project standard?

#### ðŸ˜• Why Observer?
1. Javascript is based on Observer. 
2. Web is based on Javascript. 
3. Then web is extremely important.
4. So Observer is the most used project standard.
It's a surviving rule.

In Javascript observer is usually called Event Handler. In Java, is called Listener but stills the same standard. Callback function uses observer.
